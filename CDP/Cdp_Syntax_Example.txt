A tag in a document will look something like:

<<[claimant.first_name] :Upper>>
<<doc [../Components/File.docx]>>
<<if [claimant.gender == male]>>Some Stuff Here<<@if>>

Meaning the corresponding CDP statements are:

[claimant.first_name] :Upper
doc [../Components/File.docx]
if [claimant.gender == male]

The @if isn't a statement, any tags starting with @ are going to be automatically removed
from the document.
